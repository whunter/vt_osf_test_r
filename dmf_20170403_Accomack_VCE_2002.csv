This hydro layer includes rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water. Attribution of this data set is limited. It does not indicate the directional flow of water. The supplemental METADATA file included with the data contains an image below the Hydrography section that shows the hydro layer (left side of illustration) and the hydro layer superimposed on top of aerial photography (right side of the illustration). Also note that only visible water resources were digitized. (Water passing below underpasses were not digitized). This data set is the most spatially accurate available, but it does not conform to National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) specifications (due to limitations associated with attribution, water flow, segmentation, and connectivity). 

Intermittent streams are likely not contained in this file. Data was only collected in canals and ditches where water was visible (using aerial photography from spring 2002. It should be noted that 2002 was an exceptionally dry spring in Virginia). 

Ancillary data included in this dataset or from other sources (including the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), contour lines, and even the Digital Raster Graphic [DRG] can be integrated with this file to support the delineation of flow direction. 

Spatial hydrologic features include:Streams and Rivers – Only streams with visible water will be collected. Streams will be single line up to 8 feet wide for 100 scale, or 30 feet wide for 200 and 400 scale. Double lines, representing left and right bank, will be collected where those dimensions are exceeded. 

Lakes and Ponds – Lakes and ponds will not be differentiated. Only lakes and ponds with visible water will be collected. The minimum dimension for collection is 100 feet in length or width. Canals and Ditches – Canals and ditches will not be differentiated. Only canals and ditches with visible water will be collected. Canals and ditches will be single line up to 8 feet wide for 100 scale, or 30 feet wide for 200 and 400 scale. Where those dimensions are exceeded, two lines will be placed, one to represent each bank. 

Swamps and Marshes – Swamps and marshes will not be differentiated. Only clearly identifiable swamps and marshes will be collected. The minimum dimension for collection is 1,000 feet in length or width. 

Shorelines – Shorelines for the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay will be collected at the visible land/water interface. If the shoreline is bordered by tidal marsh, the shoreline will be collected at the land/marsh interface, not the marsh/ water interface. Tidal marshes will be collected in Layer 4.

Each contour line is associated with an elevation (number of feet above sea level) in the attribute database. Contours were generated from the TIN (see description under DTM on page 6 of the supplemental METADATA FILE). Note that these contours are suitable for general landscape planning and educational purposes only. They are not survey-grade quality, and are not intended to support applications that require survey-quality data. These contours should be used for general reference and educational purposes only. The contour interval is 20 feet for counties/localities that lie west of the fall line (I-95 corridor) and 10 feet for localities that lie east of the fall line (I-95). The supplemental METADATA file included with the data contains an illustration below the Contour section that shows contours (left) and contours draped over aerial photography (right).

Contours are used as a visual tool to understand general topographic landscape characteristics. In addition, contours can be “queried” so that users can quickly identify areas above or below certain elevations. However, these contours have been interpolated, and are only approximate. Applications requiring precise elevation measurements will require the assistance of a professional surveyor.

The Virginia Geospatial Extension Program developed the contour layer using the TIN (described under DTM on page 6 of the supplemental METADATA file).
